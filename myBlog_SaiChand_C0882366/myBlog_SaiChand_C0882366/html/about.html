					<h1>Academic background</h1>
					<p>
						
						I have learnt how to work hard from my parents and I believe that combined effort of hard work and smart work ultimately gives success. In addition, I liked to be a competitor to others from my childhood which made me secure good grades in my academics.  I completed my 10th grade from Vignana Deepthi English Medium High School from SSC Board, Andhra Pradesh with 9.8 GPA in April, 2013. I completed Intermediate at Sri Chaitanya Junior college from Board of Intermediate Education, Andhra Pradesh with 94% in 2015.

						My high school education has not only provided me good fundamentals but also skills in quantitative and analytical abilities. This knowledge made me secure a good rank in the engineering entrance exam. As a result, I was able to secure admission in Electronics and Communication Engineering stream in Rajeev Gandhi Memorial College of Engineering and Technology, one of the top colleges affiliated with Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Anantapur and secured 8.69 CGPA, first class with distinction.

						I did various courses in college, starting from understanding computer hardware to learning different technologies, but I was not bound to just learning within my curriculum. Being in college, I had the freedom to explore my various interests. Since my freshman year, I started attending various technological programs, webinars and Hackathons conducted in and out of our college where I have got hands-on experience in various  technologies. During this period, I realized the impact of technology in our daily lives.

						During my under graduation, I also learned theoretical concepts on C programming, Java programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer networks, Software architecture and design which are foundational subjects to the course I selected. This sharpened my preliminary knowledge and made me realize that I have a true passion towards this and it made me curious to explore more into this field. I avidly took up Arduino programming course in college and successfully completed the course by doing couple of real time projects through Arduino programming. Additionally, with my keen interest in computers I had given a paper presentation on “Blue Eyes Technology” in a National Level symposium (Mohanamantra-2K17) held at Sri Vidyanikethan college, Tirupati. I was also an active member of the school and college event organization team and led some of them. All of these academic excellences set strong foundations for me to drive my career in the direction of Computer Engineering.

					<h1>Work Experience</h1>
					<p>
						
						In January 2019, I came across job openings in Infosys Limited and applied for campus pool hiring drive as a part of hiring process. I took the written test, followed by few interview procedures and successfully secured a job for the role of Systems Engineer. I joined Infosys on 14th October 2019. I initially had my training in Python programming, Data base management systems, Power shell scripting and UNIX shell scripting for 4 months and then started working in full time projects. I worked in Infosys for a total of 32 months till June 2022 including the training and then joined Harman Connected Services (subsidiary of Samsung Electronics) as a product Engineer in June 2022. During this job experience and exposure, I realized that being a full stack developer is utmost important for a developer in IT industry. This also gave me a realistic on-field experience and I was able to enhance my skills and explore technicalities. I feel the relevancy of my program here as software development plays an incredibly important part in the job of a computer science professional. After consulting with a couple of my managers and colleagues, I came to the realization that my existing technical know-how and expertise in computer science covers only a tiny fraction of this vast field and that’s the moment I decided to enroll in this computer science course. But I must admit that these roles gave me the interest kick that led me to decide that I would pursue this in my career. This understanding of the need of a quality education motivated to pursue a professional Computer science program which will eventually give a boost to my profile.
