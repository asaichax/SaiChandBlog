			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to introduce myself as a passionate learner and an enthusiastic professional on a quest to obtain the treasure of knowledge from a Canadian higher education program. It gives me immense pleasure to share with you that I have successfully got admission to the <strong>“Full-stack Software Development”</strong>, a two-year program with Co-op option, in <strong>Lambton College</strong>, Toronto. My academic and professional backgrounds and the reasons for selecting the course and my plans post-completion of my studies are detailed in this blog.<br>I come from the beautiful Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh, which is known for its scenic beauty and greenery. My family is well-settled with our properties and also have cordial relations with our personal and professional contacts in Chittoor and Bangalore. We exchange pleasantries and also meet and greet each other on special occasions, religious functions and other social gatherings. 

I feel extremely responsible towards my family who are so supportive to me in every phase of my life and wish to look after them in their old age. I also need to take care of my family-owned assets present in my hometown.
